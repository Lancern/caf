# Build CAF

CAF can be built into two disjoint parts: the LLVM pass and the fuzzing server.

## Build the LLVM Pass

Before building the LLVM pass, make sure you have LLVM source code checked out on your platform. If not, please refer to [here](http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html) for instructions on checking out LLVM's source code.
